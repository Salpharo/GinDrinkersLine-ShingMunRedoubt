## EXPLORING PHYGITALIZATION : PRESERVING AND PLAYING THROUGH WAR-TIME ARCHITECTURE

## Introduction

> Despite its often unpleasant aspects, wartime architecture serves as a crucial testament to humanity's complex history, embodying narratives that necessitate confrontation and understanding. This paper examines the potential of integrating Mixed Reality (MR) and engaging interactive elements to enhance the preservation of such architecture, focusing on the Shing Mun Redoubt in Hong Kong. This study proposes a framework that combines technologies with architectural context and narrative to facilitate immersive interactions between users and both physical and virtual environments. By employing the Design-Tool-Platform (DPT) framework, the research demonstrates the feasibility of phygitalization as a method for preserving wartime heritage. This work contributes to the field of Architectural Informatics and offers a promising alternative for conserving cultural heritage in a rapidly evolving technological environment.

This is my final year project in Interior and Environment Design from Polytechnic University. This initiative aims to conservate and phygitalize the Shing Mun Redoubt, bring the war-time architecture into Unity. This project provides a platform to discus the intergration of gamification within the Unity environment.
